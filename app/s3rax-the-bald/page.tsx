			S3 strolls in with a polished head,<br/>
			Looking like a lightbulb right out of bed.<br/>
			No hair, no flair, just skin so bare,<br/>
			Even mirrors say, “bro, that’s unfair.”<br/>
			<br/>
			Ain’t no part, no fade, no curl,<br/>
			Just straight up scalp for all the world.<br/>
			His barber quit, no job to do,<br/>
			Just wiped his dome and said, “[we’re] through.”<br/>
			<br/>
			Shiny like a bowling ball,<br/>
			Birds mistake him for a mall.<br/>
			“Land here?” They think, “[it’s] smooth and wide!”,<br/>
			S3 just sighs and swats with pride.<br/>
			<br/>
			He don’t need no shampoo shelf,<br/>
			Head so slick, it cleans itself.<br/>
			But wear a hat? That thing might slide,<br/>
			His scalp’s got zero grip or pride.<br/>
			<br/>
			Still he owns it, chrome with class,<br/>
			No hair? No problem[,] just sass and gas.<br/>
			So laugh with him, not at his head,<br/>
			He’s got more shine than brains instead.<br/>
